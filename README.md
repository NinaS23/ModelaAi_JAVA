# about the project
a project based on another project on my github, which is: [cars_api_java](https://github.com/NinaS23/Cars_Api_Java),I chose to do it separately for educational purposes.
The objective of this part of the project was to organize in two folders: a folder for the Models ( a Java object that represents an item in the application domain)  and a folder for the repositories
